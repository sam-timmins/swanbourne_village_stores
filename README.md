# Background
Swanbourne Village Stores is a small Post Office and convenience store set in the small village of Swanbourne in Buckinghamshire, England. The store has recently been taken over by Julie and Jean-Claude since the couple returned to the village after living in France for 22 years. 

With business slow to nearly non-existent, and Jean-Claude a trained chef, the idea of a high-end restaurant takeaway service was born over a bottle or two of red wine. This has taken off over the past 9 months with approximately 140 regular weekly customers ordering a three-course takeaway meal along with many one-off meals totalling approximately 450 dishes per week, accompanied by 150 bottles of various wines.

All of the store's business is from word of mouth, there has been no advertisement, only a small amount of promotion via Facebook.

The customer base is 30-year-old professionals to 80 plus-year-old senior citizens, with the bulk of the customers in the 55 plus age groups. The near-complete lack of digital marketing and online presence is what the owners put the fall-off in numbers in the lower age brackets down to.

The current method of dealing with orders is time-consuming and paperwork heavy. On a Monday morning, a menu for the week is emailed out to a mail list of 153 people, no orders are taken via e-mail as mails have been lost in the past leading to customers turning up to pick up an order and it is not prepared. All orders are taken over the phone and manually recorded in an order book along with a collection day, Thursday to Saturday of the same week. When the order has been completed it gets highlighted in the order book in orange and then green on the collection.

The customer also only pays on the collection, leading to potential lost revenue if a meal has been prepared and doesn't get collected. To protect slightly from this, if this situation occurs, the meals are frozen and sold during the following week to walk-in customers of the store.



# Mission Statement
To create an e-commerce application that will enable Swanbourne Village Stores to increase their customer base for their high-end takeaway business and wine store.

# Target Audience
The customers who use Swanbourne Village Stores currently ranges from 30-year-old professionals to 80 plus-year-old senior citizens. However, the owners of the store are looking to increase their 30 to 55 age bracket customers with the convenience of a click, purchase and collect web application, so primarily this is the target audience for the application.

# Stakeholder Interviews

## User Persona
Interviews were carried out with the owners of Swanbourne Village Store, customers that already use the current service and customers of the convenience store that has not yet used the takeaway service.

I managed to get a varied range of ages in the category of customers that do not yet use the service, however, I was unable to interview anyone in the lower age brackets that do use the take-away service.

### Strategy Outline
The items are graded in a 0 - 5 system in both importance and feasibility as per the grading system below.

&nbsp;

| | Score - 0 | Score - 3 | Score - 5 |
|--|--|--| -- |
| Importance | Unwise use of time to address | Efforts should be made to accommodate these | Efforts MUST be made to address these
| Feasibility | Unwise use of time to address| Efforts should be made to accommodate these | Efforts MUST be made to address these

&nbsp;

The outcome is calculated by combining the scores from the *Importance* and *Feasibility* ratings. This then gives a final strategy rating of what items and where to focus on.

| | Score - 0 | Score - 5 | Score - 10 |
|--|--|--| -- |
| Item Description | Not viable | Efforts should be made | Efforts MUST be made
